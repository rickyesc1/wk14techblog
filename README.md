# Tech Blog

The assignment from UCSD coding bootcamp for week 14 that was completed collaboratively in-class.

## Motivation & Description

The assignment for this project was to create a "CMS-Style Blog" similar to a Wordpress site wher edevelopers can publish blog posts, comment on other's posts, and delete posts. 

Motivation was to do this as a group so that any questions could be properly addressed, and to showcase the techs used.  

The app is deployed on Heroku and showcases a number of familiar JavaScript techs and new concepts such as seqeulize, express and npm packages (like express-session), and it even uses Handlebars.js for the templating.

## Deployed App:

<<<<<<< HEAD
You can find the deployed app on the following heroku link: [https://thawing-sea-63259.herokuapp.com/]

## Installation

To access the code for the app and use it for your own purposes, navigate to the github repository for the code [https://github.com/rickyesc1/wk14techblog] and clone it to your local machine.

Make sure you have heroku installed in your CLI and follow the commands to deploy your own app.

If you just wish to look at/modify the code, use a text-editor like VS Code to do so.
