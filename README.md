# Tech Blog

The assignment from UCSD coding bootcamp for week 14 that was completed collaboratively in-class.

## Motivation & Description

The assignment for this project was to create a "CMS-Style Blog" similar to a Wordpress site wher edevelopers can publish blog posts, comment on other's posts, and delete posts. 

Motivation was to do this as a group so that any questions could be properly addressed, and to showcase the techs used.  

The app is deployed on Heroku and showcases a number of familiar JavaScript techs and new concepts such as seqeulize, express and npm packages (like express-session), and it even uses Handlebars.js for the templating.
